2. Execute the following commands and observe their output:
   - `whoami`: Displays the current username.
   - `pwd`: Prints the current working directory.
   - `cd`: Changes the directory (try navigating to different directories).
   - `ls`: Lists the files and directories in the current location.

## Answer Key:

- **`whoami`**: 
  - **Purpose:** Identify the current user.
  - **Output:** The output is typically a single word that represents the username of the current session.
  - **Example Output:** `jslinux`

- **`pwd`**:
  - **Purpose:** Check the present working directory to know where you are in the filesystem.
  - **Output:** It returns the full path of the current directory.
  - **Example Output:** `/root`

- **`cd`**:
  - **Purpose:** Change the working directory to navigate through the filesystem.
  - **Notes:** 
    - `cd /home`: Changes the directory to `/home`.
    - `cd ..`: Goes up one level in the directory tree.
    - No output if the command is successful; errors are shown if the directory does not exist.
  - **Challenges:** Remembering the exact path names and structure.

- **`ls`**:
  - **Purpose:** List directory contents.
  - **Notes:** 
    - `ls`: Basic listing of directory contents.
    - `ls -l`: Long format listing, which includes additional details like file permissions, number of links, owner, group, size, and time of last modification.
  - **Example Output:**
    ```
