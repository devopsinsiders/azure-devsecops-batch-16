### Terraform Assignment: State Locking and Dependencies

**Objective:**
To understand and demonstrate the concepts of Terraform state locking, state locking with Azure Storage Account, implicit dependency, and explicit dependency through practical implementation.

**Requirements:**
- An Azure account
- Terraform installed on your local machine
- Basic understanding of Terraform and Azure

**Assignment Tasks:**

#### Part 1: Setting Up State Locking with Azure Storage Account

1. **Create an Azure Storage Account and Container:**
   - Create a new Resource Group named `terraform-state-rg` in the `West Europe` region.
   - Create a Storage Account named `tfstatestorage` within this Resource Group.
   - Create a container named `tfstate` within the Storage Account.

2. **Configure Terraform to Use Azure Storage Account for State Management:**
   - Write a Terraform configuration that sets up the backend to use the Azure Storage Account created in step 1 for storing the state file.
   - Use the following configuration as a reference:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name   = "terraform-state-rg"
    storage_account_name  = "tfstatestorage"
    container_name        = "tfstate"
    key                   = "terraform.tfstate"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "examplestoracc"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}
```

3. **Initialize and Apply Terraform Configuration:**
   - Run `terraform init` to initialize the configuration.
   - Run `terraform apply` to apply the configuration and create the resources.
   - Verify that the state file is stored in the Azure Storage Account and that state locking is functioning correctly.

#### Part 2: Demonstrating Implicit Dependency

4. **Create Resources with Implicit Dependency:**
   - Write a Terraform configuration that includes an Azure Resource Group and an Azure Storage Account with implicit dependencies.
   - Use the following configuration as a reference:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "implicit_rg" {
  name     = "implicit-example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "implicit_sa" {
  name                     = "implicitstoracc"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.implicit_rg.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.implicit_rg.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}
```

5. **Apply and Verify:**
   - Run `terraform apply` to create the resources.
   - Verify that the resources are created in the correct order based on the implicit dependencies.

#### Part 3: Demonstrating Explicit Dependency

6. **Create Resources with Explicit Dependency:**
   - Write a Terraform configuration that includes an Azure Resource Group and an Azure Storage Account with explicit dependencies.
   - Use the following configuration as a reference:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "explicit_rg" {
  name     = "explicit-example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "explicit_sa" {
  name                     = "explicitstoracc"
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.explicit_rg.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
  depends_on               = [azurerm_resource_group.explicit_rg]
}
```

7. **Apply and Verify:**
   - Run `terraform apply` to create the resources.
   - Verify that the resources are created in the correct order based on the explicit dependencies.

#### Part 4: Documentation and Reflection

8. **Document Your Work:**
   - Write a report that includes:
     - The steps you followed to complete the assignment.
     - Screenshots of the Azure portal showing the created resources.
     - Explanation of how state locking was verified.
     - Explanation of the implicit and explicit dependencies and how they were demonstrated.

9. **Reflect on the Experience:**
   - Write a short reflection on what you learned from this assignment, including any challenges faced and how you overcame them.

This assignment will help you gain hands-on experience with Terraform state management, including state locking using Azure Storage Account, and understanding both implicit and explicit dependencies in Terraform configurations.
