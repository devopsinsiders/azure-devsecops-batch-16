# Linux Basics 🐧

1. **Linux is a kernel.**
   - Linux is the core component of the operating system that manages hardware resources and provides essential services for all other software.

2. **Basic Linux Commands**
   - **pwd** (Print Working Directory)
     - Shows the current directory path.
     - Example: `pwd`

   - **cd** (Change Directory)
     - Changes the current working directory.
     - Example: `cd /path/to/directory`

   - **whoami** 🧑‍💻
     - Displays the username associated with the current session.
     - Example: `whoami`

   - **man** (Manual Pages) ℹ️
     - Displays the manual page for a command.
     - Example: `man ls` to view the manual for the `ls` command.

These basic commands are fundamental for navigating and interacting with the Linux operating system.

### Kernel vs. Operating System

1. **Definition**:
   - **Kernel**: The kernel is the core component of the operating system. It manages the system's resources (such as CPU, memory, and devices) and provides a bridge between software and hardware.
   - **Operating System**: The operating system is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs. It includes the kernel, system programs, and user interface components.

2. **Scope**:
   - **Kernel**: The kernel is a specific part of the operating system, responsible for managing the most critical aspects of the system's operation.
   - **Operating System**: The operating system includes not just the kernel but also utilities and libraries that support the functioning of the system as a whole.

3. **Functionality**:
   - **Kernel**: The kernel provides essential services, such as process management, memory management, device management, and system call handling.
   - **Operating System**: The operating system builds on the kernel's services to provide a user-friendly interface, file system management, networking capabilities, and other higher-level functionalities.

4. **Size and Complexity**:
   - **Kernel**: The kernel is typically smaller and more focused than the entire operating system, as it deals with core functionalities.
   - **Operating System**: The operating system as a whole is larger and more complex, encompassing a wide range of services and utilities.

5. **User Interaction**:
   - **Kernel**: The kernel does not directly interact with users. Instead, it provides services that user-level programs can utilize.
   - **Operating System**: The operating system includes components that directly interact with users, such as the user interface and system utilities.

In summary, the kernel is a crucial part of the operating system, responsible for managing resources and providing essential services, while the operating system as a whole includes additional components that enhance the system's functionality and provide a user-friendly interface.
